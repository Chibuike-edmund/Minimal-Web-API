# Minimal Web API with C# in .NET 6/7

This is a minimal template for creating a Web API using C# in .NET 6/7. It provides a starting point for building lightweight and efficient APIs. This template utilizes the new features and improvements introduced in .NET 6/7, allowing you to take advantage of the latest advancements in the framework.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the Minimal Web API, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- [.NET 6/7 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) or later
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (optional)

## Getting Started

To get started with the Minimal Web API, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/minimal-web-api.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
    ```
    cd minimal-web-api
3.  Run the application:
    ``` 
       dotnet run

## The API will start running on https://localhost:5001 (or http://localhost:5000).

## Usage
The Minimal Web API provides a simple "Hello, World!" endpoint to get you started. Open your favorite API testing tool or web browser and access the following endpoint:

https://localhost:5001/api/hello

You should receive a response with the message "Hello, World!".

## Customization
To customize the Minimal Web API for your specific needs, you can modify the code and add additional endpoints, controllers, and services as required. The template provides a basic structure to build upon, allowing you to create more complex APIs.
